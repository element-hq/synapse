register_new_matrix_user(1) -- Used to register new users with a given home server when registration has been disabled
======================================================================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`register_new_matrix_user` options...

## DESCRIPTION

**register_new_matrix_user** registers new users with a given home server when
registration has been disabled. For this to work, the home server must be
configured with the 'registration_shared_secret' option set.

This accepts the user credentials like the username, password, is user an
admin or not and registers the user onto the homeserver database. Also,
a YAML file containing the shared secret can be provided. If not, the
shared secret can be provided via the command line.

By default it assumes the home server URL to be `https://localhost:8448`.
This can be changed via the `server_url` command line option.

## FILES

A sample YAML file accepted by `register_new_matrix_user` is described below:

    registration_shared_secret: "s3cr3t"

## OPTIONS

  * `-u`, `--user`:
    Local part of the new user. Will prompt if omitted.

  * `-p`, `--password`:
    New password for user. Will prompt if this option and `--password-file` are omitted.
    Supplying the password on the command line is not recommended.

  * `--password-file`:
    File containing the new password for user. If set, overrides `--password`.
    This is a more secure alternative to specifying the password on the command line.

  * `-a`, `--admin`:
    Register new user as an admin. Will prompt if omitted.

  * `-c`, `--config`:
    Path to server config file containing the shared secret.

  * `-k`, `--shared-secret`:
    Shared secret as defined in server config file. This is an optional
    parameter as it can be also supplied via the YAML file.

  * `--exists-ok`:
    Do not fail if the user already exists. The user account will be not updated in this case.

  * `server_url`:
    URL of the home server. Defaults to 'https://localhost:8448'.

## EXAMPLES

    $ register_new_matrix_user -u user1 -p p@ssword -a -c config.yaml
