Template: matrix-synapse/server-name
Type: string
_Description: Name of the server:
 The name that this homeserver will appear as, to clients and other
 servers via federation. This is normally the public hostname of the
 server running synapse, but can be different if you set up delegation.
 Please refer to the delegation documentation in this case:

Template: matrix-synapse/report-stats
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Report homeserver usage statistics?
 Developers of Matrix and Synapse really appreciate helping the
 project out by reporting homeserver usage statistics from this
 homeserver. Your homeserver's server name, along with very basic
 aggregate data (e.g. number of users) will be reported. But it
 helps track the growth of the Matrix community, and helps in
 making Matrix a success, as well as to convince other networks
 that they should peer with Matrix.

 Thank you.
