# This file is maintained as an up-to-date snapshot of the default

# complete accounting of possible configuration options at

#
# It is *not* intended to be copied and used as the basis for a real
# homeserver.yaml. Instead, if you are starting from scratch, please generate
# a fresh config using Synapse by following the instructions in
