# TODO: in the future, we could use an implementation of
#   https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3527
#   https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8085
# to select the lowest possible versions, rather than resorting to this sed script.

# Patch the project definitions in-place:
# - Replace all lower and tilde bounds with exact bounds
# - Replace all caret bounds---but not the one that defines the supported Python version!
# - Delete all lines referring to psycopg2 --- so no testing of postgres support.
# - Use pyopenssl 17.0, which is the oldest version that works with
#   a `cryptography` compiled against OpenSSL 1.1.
# - Omit systemd: we're not logging to journal here.
