"""Thread-local-alike tracking of log contexts within synapse

This module provides objects and utilities for tracking contexts through
synapse code, so that log lines can include a request identifier, and so that
CPU and database activity can be accounted for against the request that caused
them.

See doc/log_contexts.rst for details on how this works.
