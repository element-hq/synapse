    This cache has two levels of key. First there is the "cache key" (of type
    `KT`), which maps to a dict. The keys to that dict are the "dict key" (of
    type `DKT`). The overall structure is therefore `KT->DKT->DV`. For
    example, it might look like:

    dict for a given cache key.

    Each dict item, and the complete dict is treated as a separate LRU
    entry for the purpose of cache expiry. For example, given:
        dict_cache.get(1, None)  -> DictionaryEntry({1: "a", 2: "b"})
        dict_cache.get(1, [1])  -> DictionaryEntry({1: "a"})
