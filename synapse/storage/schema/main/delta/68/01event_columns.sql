-- Add new colums to the `events` table which will (one day) make the `state_events`
-- and `rejections` tables redundant.

ALTER TABLE events
  -- if this event is a state event, its state key
  ADD COLUMN state_key TEXT DEFAULT NULL;


ALTER TABLE events
  -- if this event was rejected, the reason it was rejected.
  ADD COLUMN rejection_reason TEXT DEFAULT NULL;
