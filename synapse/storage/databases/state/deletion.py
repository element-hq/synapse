class StateDeletionDataStore:
    """Manages deletion of state groups in a safe manner.

    Deleting state groups is challenging as before we actually delete them we
    need to ensure that there are no in-flight events that refer to the state
    groups that we want to delete.

    To handle this, we take two approaches. First, before we persist any event
    we ensure that the state group still exists and mark in the
    `state_groups_persisting` table that the state group is about to be used.
    (Note that we have to have the extra table here as state groups and events
    can be in different databases, and thus we can't check for the existence of
    state groups in the persist event transaction). Once the event has been
    persisted, we can remove the row from  `state_groups_persisting`. So long as
    we check that table before deleting state groups, we can ensure that we
    never persist events that reference deleted state groups, maintaining
    database integrity.

    However, we want to avoid throwing exceptions so deep in the process of
    persisting events. So instead of deleting state groups immediately, we mark
    them as pending/proposed for deletion and wait for a certain amount of time
    before performing the deletion. When we come to handle new events that
    reference state groups, we check if they are pending deletion and bump the
    time for when they'll be deleted (to give a chance for the event to be
    persisted, or not).

    When deleting, we need to check that state groups remain unreferenced. There
    is a race here where we a) fetch state groups that are ready for deletion,
    b) check they're unreferenced, c) the state group becomes referenced but
    then gets marked as pending deletion again, d) during the deletion
    transaction we recheck `state_groups_pending_deletion` table again and see
    that it exists and so continue with the deletion. To prevent this from
    happening we add a `sequence_number` column to
    `state_groups_pending_deletion`, and during deletion we ensure that for a
    state group we're about to delete that the sequence number doesn't change
    between steps (a) and (d). So long as we always bump the sequence number
    whenever an event may become used the race can never happen.
    """

    # How long to wait before we delete state groups. This should be long enough
    # for any in-flight events to be persisted. If events take longer to persist
