        # Algorithm Description
        # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        #
        # The idea here is to basically walk the auth graph of each state set in
        # tandem, keeping track of which auth events are reachable by each state
        # set. If we reach an auth event we've already visited (via a different
        # state set) then we mark that auth event and all ancestors as reachable
        # by the state set. This requires that we keep track of the auth chains
        # in memory.
        #
        # Doing it in a such a way means that we can stop early if all auth
        # events we're currently walking are reachable by all state sets.
        #
        # *Note*: We can't stop walking an event's auth chain if it is reachable
        # by all state sets. This is because other auth chains we're walking
        # might be reachable only via the original auth chain. For example,
        # given the following auth chain:
        #
        #       A -> C -> D -> E
        #           /         /
        #       B -´---------´
        #
        # and state sets {A} and {B} then walking the auth chains of A and B
        # would immediately show that C is reachable by both. However, if we
        # stopped at C then we'd only reach E via the auth chain of B and so E
        # would erroneously get included in the returned difference.
        #
        # The other thing that we do is limit the number of auth chains we walk
        # at once, due to practical limits (i.e. we can only query the database
        # with a limited set of parameters). We pick the auth chains we walk
