        Retrieves the names of the workers handling a given duty, by either legacy

        There are two ways of configuring which instances handle a given duty, e.g.
        for configuring pushers:

        1. The old way where "start_pushers" is set to false and running a
          `synapse.app.pusher'` worker app.
        2. Specifying the workers sending federation in `pusher_instances`.

        Args:
            config: settings read from yaml.
            legacy_option_name: the old way of enabling options. e.g. 'start_pushers'
            legacy_app_name: The historical app name. e.g. 'synapse.app.pusher'
            modern_instance_list_name: the string name of the new instance_list. e.g.
            'pusher_instances'
