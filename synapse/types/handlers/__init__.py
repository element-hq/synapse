                `avatar_url` and `displayname`) for the users used to calculate the room name.
            is_dm: Flag to specify whether the room is a direct-message room (most likely
                between two people).
            initial: Flag which is set when this is the first time the server is sending this
                data on this connection. Clients can use this flag to replace or update
                their local state. When there is an update, servers MUST omit this flag
                entirely and NOT send "initial":false as this is wasteful on bandwidth. The
                absence of this flag means 'false'.
            unstable_expanded_timeline: Flag which is set if we're returning more historic
                events due to the timeline limit having increased. See "XXX: Odd behavior"
                comment ing `synapse.handlers.sliding_sync`.
            required_state: The current state of the room
            timeline: Latest events in the room. The last event is the most recent.
            bundled_aggregations: A mapping of event ID to the bundled aggregations for
                the timeline events above. This allows clients to show accurate reaction
                counts (or edits, threads), even if some of the reaction events were skipped
                over in a gappy sync.
            stripped_state: Stripped state events (for rooms where the usre is
                invited/knocked). Same as `rooms.invite.$room_id.invite_state` in sync v2,
                absent on joined/left rooms
            prev_batch: A token that can be passed as a start parameter to the
                `/rooms/<room_id>/messages` API to retrieve earlier messages.
            limited: True if there are more events than `timeline_limit` looking
                backwards from the `response.pos` to the `request.pos`.
            num_live: The number of timeline events which have just occurred and are not historical.
                The last N events are 'live' and should be treated as such. This is mostly
                useful to determine whether a given @mention event should make a noise or not.
                Clients cannot rely solely on the absence of `initial: true` to determine live
                events because if a room not in the sliding window bumps into the window because
                of an @mention it will have `initial: true` yet contain a single live event
                (with potentially other old events in the timeline).
            bump_stamp: The `stream_ordering` of the last event according to the
                `bump_event_types`. This helps clients sort more readily without them
                needing to pull in a bunch of the timeline to determine the last activity.
                `bump_event_types` is a thing because for example, we don't want display
                name changes to mark the room as unread and bump it to the top. For
                encrypted rooms, we just have to consider any activity as a bump because we
                can't see the content and the client has to figure it out for themselves.
            joined_count: The number of users with membership of join, including the client's
                own user ID. (same as sync `v2 m.joined_member_count`)
            invited_count: The number of users with membership of invite. (same as sync v2
                `m.invited_member_count`)
