        _state_group: The ID of the state group for this event. Note that state events
            are persisted with a state group which includes the new event, so this is
            effectively the state *after* the event in question.

            For a *rejected* state event, where the state of the rejected event is
            ignored, this state_group should never make it into the
            event_to_state_groups table. Indeed, inspecting this value for a rejected
            state event is almost certainly incorrect.

            For an outlier, where we don't have the state at the event, this will be
            None.

            Note that this is a private attribute: it should be accessed via
            the ``state_group`` property.

        state_group_before_event: The ID of the state group representing the state
            of the room before this event.

            If this is a non-state event, this will be the same as ``state_group``. If
            it's a state event, it will be the same as ``prev_group``.

            If ``state_group`` is None (ie, the event is an outlier),
            ``state_group_before_event`` will always also be ``None``.

        state_delta_due_to_event: If `state_group` and `state_group_before_event` are not None
            then this is the delta of the state between the two groups.

        state_group_deltas: If not empty, this is a dict collecting a mapping of the state
            difference between state groups.

            The keys are a tuple of two integers: the initial group and final state group.
            The corresponding value is a state map representing the state delta between
            these state groups.

            The dictionary is expected to have at most two entries with state groups of:

            1. The state group before the event and after the event.
            2. The state group preceding the state group before the event and the
               state group before the event.

            This information is collected and stored as part of an optimization for persisting
            events.
