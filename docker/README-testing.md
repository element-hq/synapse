# Running tests against a dockerised Synapse

It's possible to run integration tests against Synapse
using [Complement](https://github.com/matrix-org/complement). Complement is a Matrix Spec
compliance test suite for homeservers, and supports any homeserver docker image configured
to listen on ports 8008/8448. This document contains instructions for building Synapse
docker images that can be run inside Complement for testing purposes.

Note that running Synapse's unit tests from within the docker image is not supported.

## Using the Complement launch script

`scripts-dev/complement.sh` is a script that will automatically build
and run Synapse against Complement.
Consult the [contributing guide][guideComplementSh] for instructions on how to use it.

## Building and running the images manually

Under some circumstances, you may wish to build the images manually.
The instructions below will lead you to doing that.

Note that these images can only be built using [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/),
therefore BuildKit needs to be enabled when calling `docker build`. This can be done by
setting `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` in your environment.

Start by building the base Synapse docker image. If you wish to run tests with the latest
release of Synapse, instead of your current checkout, you can skip this step. From the
root of the repository:

```sh
docker build -t matrixdotorg/synapse -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

Next, build the workerised Synapse docker image, which is a layer over the base
image.

```sh
docker build -t matrixdotorg/synapse-workers -f docker/Dockerfile-workers .
```

Finally, build the multi-purpose image for Complement, which is a layer over the workers image.

```sh
docker build -t complement-synapse -f docker/complement/Dockerfile docker/complement
```

This will build an image with the tag `complement-synapse`, which can be handed to
Complement for testing via the `COMPLEMENT_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable. Refer to
[Complement's documentation](https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/#running) for
how to run the tests, as well as the various available command line flags.

See [the Complement image README](./complement/README.md) for information about the
expected environment variables.


## Running the Dockerfile-worker image standalone

For manual testing of a multi-process Synapse instance in Docker,
[Dockerfile-workers](Dockerfile-workers) is a Dockerfile that will produce an image
bundling all necessary components together for a workerised homeserver instance.

This includes any desired Synapse worker processes, a nginx to route traffic accordingly,
a redis for worker communication and a supervisord instance to start up and monitor all
processes. You will need to provide your own postgres container to connect to, and TLS
is not handled by the container.

Once you've built the image using the above instructions, you can run it. Be sure
you've set up a volume according to the [usual Synapse docker instructions](README.md).
Then run something along the lines of:

```
docker run -d --name synapse \
    --mount type=volume,src=synapse-data,dst=/data \
    -p 8008:8008 \
    -e SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME=my.matrix.host \
    -e SYNAPSE_REPORT_STATS=no \
    -e POSTGRES_HOST=postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=somesecret \
    -e SYNAPSE_WORKER_TYPES=synchrotron,media_repository,user_dir \
    -e SYNAPSE_WORKERS_WRITE_LOGS_TO_DISK=1 \
    matrixdotorg/synapse-workers
```

...substituting `POSTGRES*` variables for those that match a postgres host you have
available (usually a running postgres docker container).


### Workers

The `SYNAPSE_WORKER_TYPES` environment variable is a comma-separated list of workers to
use when running the container. All possible worker names are defined by the keys of the
`WORKERS_CONFIG` variable in [this script](configure_workers_and_start.py), which the
Dockerfile makes use of to generate appropriate worker, nginx and supervisord config
files.

Sharding is supported for a subset of workers, in line with the
[worker documentation](../docs/workers.md). To run multiple instances of a given worker
type, simply specify the type multiple times in `SYNAPSE_WORKER_TYPES`
(e.g `SYNAPSE_WORKER_TYPES=event_creator,event_creator...`).

Otherwise, `SYNAPSE_WORKER_TYPES` can either be left empty or unset to spawn no workers
(leaving only the main process).
The container will only be configured to use Redis-based worker mode if there are
workers enabled.

### Logging

Logs for workers and the main process are logged to stdout and can be viewed with
standard `docker logs` tooling. Worker logs contain their worker name
after the timestamp.

Setting `SYNAPSE_WORKERS_WRITE_LOGS_TO_DISK=1` will cause worker logs to be written to
`<data_dir>/logs/<worker_name>.log`. Logs are kept for 1 week and rotate every day at 00:
00, according to the container's clock. Logging for the main process must still be
configured by modifying the homeserver's log config in your Synapse data volume.


### Application Services

Setting the `SYNAPSE_AS_REGISTRATION_DIR` environment variable to the path of
a directory (within the container) will cause the configuration script to scan
that directory for `.yaml`/`.yml` registration files.
Synapse will be configured to load these configuration files.


### TLS Termination

Nginx is present in the image to route requests to the appropriate workers,
but it does not serve TLS by default.

You can configure `SYNAPSE_TLS_CERT` and `SYNAPSE_TLS_KEY` to point to a
TLS certificate and key (respectively), both in PEM (textual) format.
In this case, Nginx will additionally serve using HTTPS on port 8448.
