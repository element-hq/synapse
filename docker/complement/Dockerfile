# This dockerfile builds on top of 'docker/Dockerfile-workers' in element-hq/synapse
# by including a built-in postgres instance, as well as setting up the homeserver so
# that it is ready for testing via Complement.

# Instructions for building this image from those it depends on is detailed in this guide:

# First of all, we copy postgres server from the official postgres image,
# since for repeated rebuilds, this is much faster than apt installing
# postgres each time.

# This trick only works because (a) the Synapse image happens to have all the
# shared libraries that postgres wants, (b) we use a postgres image based on
# the same debian version as Synapse's docker image (so the versions of the
# shared libraries match).
