  server_name:
    type: string
    description: >-
      This sets the public-facing domain of the server.


      The `server_name` name will appear at the end of usernames and room
      addresses created on your server. For example if the `server_name` was
      example.com, usernames on your server would be in the format
      `@user:example.com`.


      In most cases you should avoid using a matrix specific subdomain such as
      matrix.example.com or synapse.example.com as the `server_name` for the
      same reasons you wouldn't use user@email.example.com as your email
      address. See [here](../../delegate.md) for information on how to host
      Synapse on a subdomain while preserving a clean `server_name`.


      The `server_name` cannot be changed later so it is important to configure
      this correctly before you start Synapse. It should be all lowercase and
      may contain an explicit port.
    examples:
      - matrix.org
      - localhost:8080
  pid_file:
    type: ["string", "null"]

  daemonize:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Specifies whether Synapse should be started as a daemon process. If
      Synapse is being managed by [systemd](../../systemd-with-workers/), this
      option must be omitted or set to `false`.


      This can also be set by the `--daemonize` (`-D`) argument when starting
      Synapse.


      See `worker_daemonize` for more information on daemonizing workers.
    default: false
    examples:
      - true
  print_pidfile:
    type: boolean
    description: >-

  public_baseurl:
    type: ["string", "null"]
    description: >-
      The public-facing base URL that clients use to access this Homeserver (not
      including _matrix/...). This is the same URL a user might enter into the
      "Custom Homeserver URL" field on their client. If you use Synapse with a
      reverse proxy, this should be the URL to reach Synapse via the proxy.
      Otherwise, it should be the URL to reach Synapse's client HTTP listener
      (see [`listeners`](#listeners) below).


      If unset or null, `https://<server_name>/` is used.
    default: null
    examples:
      - "https://example.com/"
  serve_server_wellknown:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      By default, other servers will try to reach our server on port 8448, which
      can be inconvenient in some environments.


      Provided `https://<server_name>/` on port 443 is routed to Synapse, this
      option configures Synapse to serve a file at
      `https://<server_name>/.well-known/matrix/server`. This will tell other
      servers to send traffic to port 443 instead.


      This option currently defaults to false.


      See [Delegation of incoming federation traffic](../../delegate.md) for
      more information.
    default: false
    examples:
      - true
  extra_well_known_client_content:
    type: object
    description: >-
      This option allows server runners to add arbitrary key-value pairs to the
      [client-facing `.well-known`
      response](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#well-known-uri).
      Note that the `public_baseurl` config option must be provided for Synapse
      to serve a response to `/.well-known/matrix/client` at all.


      If this option is provided, it parses the given yaml to json and serves it
      on `/.well-known/matrix/client` endpoint alongside the standard
      properties.

          Can also be set to a special value of "untracked" which ignores
          updates received via clients and federation, while still accepting
          updates from the [module API](../../modules/index.md).

      it defaults to private IP address ranges (see the example below).


      The blacklist applies to the outbound requests for federation, identity
      servers, push servers, and for checking key validity for third-party
      invite events.


      (0.0.0.0 and :: are always blacklisted, whether or not they are explicitly
      listed here, since they correspond to unroutable addresses.)


      This option replaces `federation_ip_range_blacklist` in Synapse v1.25.0.

  listeners:

      List of ports that Synapse should listen on, their purpose and their
      configuration.


      Valid resource names are:


      * `client`: the client-server API (/_matrix/client). Also implies `media`
      and `static`. If configuring the main process, the Synapse Admin API
      (/_synapse/admin) is also implied.


      * `consent`: user consent forms (/_matrix/consent). See
      [here](../../consent_tracking.md) for more.


      * `federation`: the server-server API (/_matrix/federation). Also implies
      `media`, `keys`, `openid`


      * `keys`: the key discovery API (/_matrix/key).


      * `media`: the media API (/_matrix/media).


      * `metrics`: the metrics interface. See [here](../../metrics-howto.md).
      (Not compatible with Unix sockets)


      * `openid`: OpenID authentication. See [here](../../openid.md).


      * `replication`: the HTTP replication API (/_synapse/replication). See
      [here](../../workers.md).


      * `static`: static resources under synapse/static (/_matrix/static).
      (Mostly useful for "fallback authentication".)


      * `health`: the [health check
      endpoint](../../reverse_proxy.md#health-check-endpoint). This endpoint is
      by default active for all other resources and does not have to be
      activated separately. This is only useful if you want to use the health
      endpoint explicitly on a dedicated port or for [workers](../../workers.md)
      and containers without listener e.g. [application
      services](../../workers.md#notifying-application-services).

      an `org.matrix.dummy_event` event, which will reduce the forward
      extremities in the room.

        description: >-
          Server admins can define the settings of the background jobs purging
          the events whose lifetime has expired under the `purge_jobs` section.


          If no configuration is provided for this option, a single job will be
          set up to delete expired events in every room daily.


          Each job's configuration defines which range of message lifetimes the
          job takes care of. For example, if `shortest_max_lifetime` is "2d" and
          `longest_max_lifetime` is "3d", the job will handle purging expired
          events in rooms whose state defines a `max_lifetime` that's both
          higher than 2 days, and lower than or equal to 3 days. Both the
          minimum and the maximum value of a range are optional, e.g. a job with
          no `shortest_max_lifetime` and a `longest_max_lifetime` of "3d" will
          handle every room with a retention policy whose `max_lifetime` is
          lower than or equal to three days.


          The rationale for this per-job configuration is that some rooms might
          have a retention policy with a low `max_lifetime`, where history needs
          to be purged of outdated messages on a more frequent basis than for
          the rest of the rooms (e.g. every 12h), but not want that purge to be
          performed by a job that's iterating over every room it knows, which
          could be heavy on the server.


          If any purge job is configured, it is strongly recommended to have at
          least a single job with neither `shortest_max_lifetime` nor
          `longest_max_lifetime` set, or one job without `shortest_max_lifetime`
          and one job without `longest_max_lifetime` set. Otherwise some rooms
          might be ignored, even if `allowed_lifetime_min` and
          `allowed_lifetime_max` are set, because capping a room's policy to
          these values is done after the policies are retrieved from Synapse's
          database (which is done using the range specified in a purge job's
          configuration).

      ### Reloading cache factors


      The cache factors (i.e. `caches.global_factor` and
      `caches.per_cache_factors`)  may be reloaded at any time by sending a
      [`SIGHUP`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGHUP) signal to Synapse
      using e.g.


      ```commandline

      kill -HUP [PID_OF_SYNAPSE_PROCESS]

      ```


      If you are running multiple workers, you must individually update the
      worker config file and send this signal to each worker process.


      If you're using the [example systemd
      service](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/blob/develop/contrib/systemd/matrix-synapse.service)
      file in Synapse's `contrib` directory, you can send a `SIGHUP` signal by
      using `systemctl reload matrix-synapse`.

          This can also be set by the `SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR` environment
          variable. Setting by environment variable takes priority over setting
          through the config file.


          Defaults to 0.5, which will halve the size of all caches.


          Note that changing this value also affects the HTTP connection pool.
        default: 0.5
      per_cache_factors:

        description: >-

          These can also be set through environment variables comprised of
          `SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR_` + the name of the cache in capital letters and
          underscores. Setting by environment variable takes priority over
          setting through the config file. Ex.
          `SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR_GET_USERS_WHO_SHARE_ROOM_WITH_USER=2.0`


          Some caches have '*' and other characters that are not alphanumeric or

  databases:
    type: object
    description: >-
      The `databases` option allows specifying a mapping between certain
      database tables and database host details, spreading the load of a single
      Synapse instance across multiple database backends. This is often referred
      to as "database sharding". This option is only supported for PostgreSQL
      database backends.


      **Important note:** This is a supported option, but is not currently used
      in production by the Matrix.org Foundation. Proceed with caution and
      always make backups.


      `databases` is a dictionary of arbitrarily-named database entries. Each
      entry is equivalent to the value of the `database` homeserver config
      option (see above), with the addition of a `data_stores` key.
      `data_stores` is an array of strings that specifies the data store(s) (a
      defined label for a set of tables) that should be stored on the associated
      database backend entry.


      The currently defined values for `data_stores` are:


      * `"state"`: Database that relates to state groups will be stored in this
      database.

        Specifically, that means the following tables:
        * `state_groups`
        * `state_group_edges`
        * `state_groups_state`

        And the following sequences:
        * `state_groups_seq_id`

      * `"main"`: All other database tables and sequences.


      All databases will end up with additional tables used for tracking
      database schema migrations and any pending background updates. Synapse
      will create these automatically on startup when checking for and/or
      performing database schema migrations.


      To migrate an existing database configuration (e.g. all tables on a single
      database) to a different configuration (e.g. the "main" data store on one
      database, and "state" on another), do the following:


      1. Take a backup of your existing database. Things can and do go wrong and
      database corruption is no joke!

      2. Ensure all pending database migrations have been applied and background
      updates have run. The simplest way to do this is to use the
      `update_synapse_database` script supplied with your Synapse installation.

         ```sh
         update_synapse_database --database-config homeserver.yaml --run-background-updates
         ```

      3. Copy over the necessary tables and sequences from one database to the
      other. Tables relating to database migrations, schemas, schema versions
      and background updates should **not** be copied.

         As an example, say that you'd like to split out the "state" data store from an existing database which currently contains all data stores.

         Simply copy the tables and sequences defined above for the "state" datastore from the existing database to the secondary database. As noted above, additional tables will be created in the secondary database when Synapse is started.

      4. Modify/create the `databases` option in your `homeserver.yaml` to match
      the desired database configuration.

      5. Start Synapse. Check that it starts up successfully and that things
      generally seem to be working.

      6. Drop the old tables that were copied in step 3.


      Only one of the options `database` or `databases` may be specified in your
      config, but not both.

  enable_authenticated_media:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      When set to true, all subsequent media uploads will be marked as
      authenticated, and will not be available over legacy unauthenticated media
      endpoints (`/_matrix/media/(r0|v3|v1)/download` and
      `/_matrix/media/(r0|v3|v1)/thumbnail`) – requests for authenticated media
      over these endpoints will result in a 404. All media, including
      authenticated media, will be available over the authenticated media
      endpoints `_matrix/client/v1/media/download` and
      `_matrix/client/v1/media/thumbnail`. Media uploaded prior to setting this
      option to true will still be available over the legacy endpoints. Note if
      the setting is switched to false after enabling, media marked as
      authenticated will be available over legacy endpoints. Defaults to true
      (previously false). In a future release of Synapse, this option will be
      removed and become always-on.


      In all cases, authenticated requests to download media will succeed, but
      for unauthenticated requests, this case-by-case breakdown describes
      whether media downloads are permitted:


      * `enable_authenticated_media = False`:
        * unauthenticated client or homeserver requesting local media: allowed
        * unauthenticated client or homeserver requesting remote media: allowed as long as the media is in the cache, or as long as the remote homeserver does not require authentication to retrieve the media
      * `enable_authenticated_media = True`:
        * unauthenticated client or homeserver requesting local media: allowed if the media was stored on the server whilst `enable_authenticated_media` was `False` (or in a previous Synapse version where this option did not exist); otherwise denied.
        * unauthenticated client or homeserver requesting remote media: the same as for local media; allowed if the media was stored on the server whilst `enable_authenticated_media` was `False` (or in a previous Synapse version where this option did not exist); otherwise denied.

      It is especially notable that media downloaded before this option existed
      (in older Synapse versions), or whilst this option was set to `False`,
      will perpetually be available over the legacy, unauthenticated endpoint,
      even after this option is set to `True`. This is for backwards
      compatibility with older clients and homeservers that do not yet support
      requesting authenticated media; those older clients or homeservers will
      not be cut off from media they can already see.


      _Changed in Synapse 1.120:_ This option now defaults to `True` when not

      remote media downloads. This configuration option sets the size of the
      bucket against which the size in bytes of downloads are penalized – if the
      bucket is full, i.e. a given number of bytes have already been downloaded,
      further downloads will be denied until the bucket drains. See also

      Works in conjunction with `remote_media_download_burst_count` to ratelimit
      remote media downloads – this configuration option determines the rate at
      which the "bucket" (see above) leaks in bytes per second. As requests are
      made to download remote media, the size of those requests in bytes is
      added to the bucket, and once the bucket has reached it's capacity, no
      more requests will be allowed until a number of bytes has "drained" from
      the bucket. This setting determines the rate at which bytes drain from the
      bucket, with the practical effect that the larger the number, the faster
      the bucket leaks, allowing for more bytes downloaded over a shorter period
      of time. Defaults to 87KiB per second. See also

      the worker that has the `enable_media_repo` homeserver config option set
      to `true`). This may be the main process.


      The `media_retention.local_media_lifetime` and

      media will be purged if it has not been accessed in a given amount of

      bypass the blacklist. This is more useful if you know there is an entire
      shape of URL that you know that you do not want Synapse to preview.


      Each list entry is a dictionary of url component attributes as returned by
      urlparse.urlsplit as applied to the absolute form of the URL. See

      * `username`

      * `netloc`

      * `scheme`

      * `path`


      The values of the dictionary are treated as a filename match pattern

      When a user wishes to add a phone number to their account, we need to
      verify that they actually own that phone number, which requires sending
      them a text message (SMS). Currently Synapse does not support sending
      those texts itself and instead delegates the task to an identity server.
      The base URI for the identity server to be used is specified by the
      `account_threepid_delegates.msisdn` option.


      If this is left unspecified, Synapse will not allow users to add phone
      numbers to their account.

      By default the auto-created rooms are publicly joinable from any federated
      server. Use the `autocreate_auto_join_rooms_federated` and
      `autocreate_auto_join_room_preset` settings to customise this behaviour.

      Possible values for this option are:

      servers if `autocreate_auto_join_rooms_federated` is true (the default).

      * "private_chat": an invitation is required to join these rooms.

      * "trusted_private_chat": an invitation is required to join this room and
      the invitee is assigned a power level of 100 upon joining the room.

      The user id is also used to invite new users to any auto-join rooms which
      are set to invite-only.


      It *must* be configured if `autocreate_auto_join_room_preset` is set to
      "private_chat" or "trusted_private_chat".


      Note that this must be specified in order for new users to be correctly
      invited to any auto-join rooms which have been set to invite-only (either

      be active.


      This defaults to 0, meaning the user is queried for their credentials
      before every action, but this can be overridden to allow a single
      validation to be re-used. This weakens the protections afforded by the
      user-interactive authentication process, by allowing for multiple (and
      potentially different) operations to use the same validation session.


      This is ignored for potentially "dangerous" operations (including
      deactivating an account, modifying an account password, adding a 3PID, and

      When we need to fetch a signing key, each server is tried in parallel.


      Normally, the connection to the key server is validated via TLS
      certificates. Additional security can be provided by configuring a `verify
      key`, which will make synapse check that the response is signed by that
      key.


      This setting supersedes an older setting named `perspectives`. The old
      format is still supported for backwards-compatibility, but it is
      deprecated.


      `trusted_key_servers` defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a
      warning on start-up. To suppress this warning, set
      `suppress_key_server_warning` to true.


      If the use of a trusted key server has to be deactivated, e.g. in a
      private federation or for privacy reasons, this can be realised by setting
      an empty array (`trusted_key_servers: []`). Then Synapse will request the
      keys directly from the server that owns the keys. If Synapse does not get

      to configure these options.


      For backwards compatibility, it is also possible to configure a single
      OIDC provider via an `oidc_config` setting. This is now deprecated and
      admins are advised to migrate to the `oidc_providers` format. (When doing
      that migration, use `oidc` for the `idp_id` to ensure that existing users
      continue to be recognised.)


      It is possible to configure Synapse to only allow logins if certain
      attributes match particular values in the OIDC userinfo. The requirements
      can be listed under `attribute_requirements` as shown here:

      ```yaml

      attribute_requirements:
        - attribute: family_name
          one_of: ["Stephensson", "Smith"]
        - attribute: groups
          value: "admin"
        # If `value` or `one_of` are not specified, the attribute only needs
        # to exist, regardless of value.
        - attribute: picture
      ```


      `attribute` is a required field, while `value` and `one_of` are optional.


      All of the listed attributes must match for the login to be permitted.
      Additional attributes can be added to userinfo by expanding the `scopes`
      section of the OIDC config to retrieve additional information from the
      OIDC provider.


      If the OIDC claim is a list, then the attribute must match any value in
      the list. Otherwise, it must exactly match the value of the claim. Using
      the example above, the `family_name` claim MUST be either "Stephensson" or
      "Smith", but the `groups` claim MUST contain "admin".

            This is *not* required if `discovery` is disabled. We default to
            supporting `RS256` in the downstream usage if no algorithms are
            configured here or in the discovery document.


            According to the spec, the algorithm `"RS256"` MUST be included. The
            absolute rigid approach would be to reject this provider as
            non-compliant if it's not included but we simply allow whatever and
            see what happens (you're the one that configured the value and
            cooperating with the identity provider).


            The `alg` value `"none"` MAY be supported but can only be used if
            the Authorization Endpoint does not include `id_token` in the
            `response_type` (ex. `/authorize?response_type=code` where `none`
            can apply, `/authorize?response_type=code%20id_token` where `none`

                For the default provider, the following settings are available:


                * `subject_template`: Jinja2 template for a unique identifier
                for the user. Defaults to `{{ user.sub }}`, which OpenID Connect
                compliant providers should provide.

                  This replaces and overrides `subject_claim`.

                * `subject_claim`: name of the claim containing a unique
                identifier for the user. Defaults to `sub`, which OpenID Connect
                compliant providers should provide.

                  *Deprecated in Synapse v1.75.0.*

                * `picture_template`: Jinja2 template for an url for the user's
                profile picture. Defaults to `{{ user.picture }}`, which OpenID
                Connect compliant providers should provide and has to refer to a
                direct image file such as PNG, JPEG, or GIF image file.

                  This replaces and overrides `picture_claim`.

                  Currently only supported in monolithic (single-process) server configurations where the media repository runs within the Synapse process.

                * `picture_claim`: name of the claim containing an url for the
                user's profile picture. Defaults to "picture", which OpenID
                Connect compliant providers should provide and has to refer to a
                direct image file such as PNG, JPEG, or GIF image file.

                  Currently only supported in monolithic (single-process) server configurations where the media repository runs within the Synapse process.

                  *Deprecated in Synapse v1.75.0.*

                * `localpart_template`: Jinja2 template for the localpart of the
                MXID. If this is not set, the user will be prompted to choose
                their own username (see the documentation for the
                `sso_auth_account_details.html` template). This template can use
                the `localpart_from_email` filter.


                * `confirm_localpart`: Whether to prompt the user to validate
                (or change) the generated localpart (see the documentation for
                the "sso_auth_account_details.html" template), instead of
                registering the account right away.


                * `display_name_template`: Jinja2 template for the display name
                to set on first login. If unset, no displayname will be set.


                * `email_template`: Jinja2 template for the email address of the
                user. If unset, no email address will be added to the account.


                * `extra_attributes`: a map of Jinja2 templates for extra
                attributes to send back to the client during login. Note that
                these are non-standard and clients will ignore them without
                modifications.

        backchannel_logout_ignore_sub:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            By default, the OIDC Back-Channel Logout feature checks that the

            `false`.


            You might want to disable this if the `subject_claim` returned by
            the mapping provider is not `sub`.

          subject to an additional confirmation step after the SSO login is
          completed.


          WARNING: An entry such as "https://my.client" is insecure, because it
          will also match "https://my.client.evil.site", exposing your users to
          phishing attacks from evil.site. To avoid this, include a slash after
          the hostname: "https://my.client/".


          The login fallback page (used by clients that don't natively support
          the required login flows) is whitelisted in addition to any URLs in

  room_list_publication_rules:
    type: ["array", "null"]
    description: >-
      The `room_list_publication_rules` option allows server admins to prevent
      unwanted entries from being published in the public room list.


      The format of this option is the same as that for
      [`alias_creation_rules`](#alias_creation_rules): an optional list of 0 or
      more rules. By default, no list is provided, meaning that no one may
      publish to the room list (except server admins).


      Otherwise, requests to publish a room are matched against each rule in
      order. The first rule that matches decides if the request is allowed or
      denied. If no rule matches, the request is denied. In particular, this
      means that configuring an empty list of rules will deny every alias
      creation request.


      Requests to create a public (public as in published to the room directory)
      room which violates the configured rules will result in the room being
      created but not published to the room directory.


      Each of the glob patterns is optional, defaulting to `*` ("match
      anything"). Note that the patterns match against fully qualified IDs, e.g.
      against `@alice:example.com`, `#room:example.com` and
      `!abcdefghijk:example.com` instead of `alice`, `room` and `abcedgghijk`.


      Each rule is a YAML object containing four fields, each of which is an
      optional string.

  default_power_level_content_override:
    type: object
    description: >-
      The `default_power_level_content_override` option controls the default
      power levels for rooms.


      Useful if you know that your users need special permissions in rooms that
      they create (e.g. to send particular types of state events without needing
      an elevated power level).  This takes the same shape as the
      `power_level_content_override` parameter in the /createRoom API, but is
      applied before that parameter.


      Note that each key provided inside a preset (for example `events` in the
      example below) will overwrite all existing defaults inside that key. So in
      Example #1, newly-created private_chat rooms will have no rules for any
      event types except `com.example.foo`.


      The default power levels for each preset are:


      ```yaml

      "m.room.name": 50

      "m.room.power_levels": 100

      "m.room.history_visibility": 100

      "m.room.canonical_alias": 50

      "m.room.avatar": 50

      "m.room.tombstone": 100

      "m.room.server_acl": 100

      "m.room.encryption": 100

      ```


      In Example #2 the default power-levels for a preset are maintained, but
      the power level for a new key is set.
    default: {}

      - private_chat:

      The way that the load balancing works is any outbound federation request
      will be assigned to a federation sender worker based on the hash of the
      destination server name. This means that all requests being sent to the
      same destination will be processed by the same worker instance. Multiple
      `federation_sender_instances` are useful if there is a federation with
      multiple servers.


      This configuration setting must be shared between all workers handling
      federation sending, and if changed all federation sender workers must be
      stopped at the same time and then started, to ensure that all instances

  worker_manhole:
    type: ["integer", "null"]
    description: >-
      A worker may have a listener for [`manhole`](../../manhole.md). It allows
      server administrators to access a Python shell on the worker.


      The example below is a short form for

      ```yaml

      worker_listeners:
        - port: 9000
          bind_addresses: ['127.0.0.1']
          type: manhole
      ```


      It needs also an additional [`manhole_settings`](#manhole_settings)
      configuration.
    default: null
    examples:
      - 9000
  worker_daemonize:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Specifies whether the worker should be started as a daemon process. If
      Synapse is being managed by [systemd](../../systemd-with-workers/), this
      option must be omitted or set to `false`.
    default: false
    examples:
      - true
  worker_pid_file:
    type: ["string", "null"]
    description: >-
      When running a worker as a daemon, we need a place to store the
      [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_identifier) of the worker.
      This option defines the location of that "pid file".


      This option is required if `worker_daemonize` is `true` and ignored
      otherwise.


      See also the [`pid_file` option](#pid_file) option for the main Synapse
      process.
    default: null
    examples:
      - DATADIR/generic_worker1.pid
  worker_log_config:
    type: ["string", "null"]
    description: >-
      This option specifies a yaml python logging config file as described
      [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#configuration-dictionary-schema).

  background_updates:
    type: object
    description: >-
      Background updates are database updates that are run in the background in
      batches. The duration, minimum batch size, default batch size, whether to
      sleep between batches and if so, how long to sleep can all be configured.
      This is helpful to speed up or slow down the updates.

  auto_accept_invites:
    type: object
    description: >-
      Automatically accepting invites controls whether users are presented with
      an invite request or if they are instead automatically joined to a room
      when receiving an invite. Set the `enabled` sub-option to true to enable
      auto-accepting invites.


      NOTE: Care should be taken not to enable this setting if the
      `synapse_auto_accept_invite` module is enabled and installed. The two
      modules will compete to perform the same task and may result in undesired
      behaviour. For example, multiple join events could be generated from a
      single invite.
    properties:
      enabled:
        type: boolean
        description: Whether to run the auto-accept invites logic.
        default: false
      only_for_direct_messages:

          (for SQLite) or `psycopg2` (for PostgreSQL). If no name is specified
          Synapse will default to SQLite.

      allow_unsafe_locale:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          This option is specific to Postgres. Under the default behavior,
          Synapse will refuse to start if the postgres db is set to a non-C
          locale. You can override this behavior (which is *not* recommended) by
          setting `allow_unsafe_locale` to true. Note that doing so may corrupt
          your database. You can find more information
          [here](../../postgres.md#fixing-incorrect-collate-or-ctype) and
          [here](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Locale_data_changes).
