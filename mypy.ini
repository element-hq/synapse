;; Dependencies without annotations
;; Before ignoring a module, check to see if type stubs are available.
;; The `typeshed` project maintains stubs here:
;;     https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs
;; and for each package `foo` there's a corresponding `types-foo` package on PyPI,
;; which we can pull in as a dev dependency by adding to `pyproject.toml`'s
;; `[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]` list.
