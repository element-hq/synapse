# mypy has a limitation where it only chooses the first plugin that returns a non-None
# value for each hook (known-limitation, c.f.
# https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/19524). We workaround this by putting our custom
# plugin first in the plugin order and then manually calling any other conflicting
# plugin hooks in our own plugin followed by our own checks.
#
# If you add a new plugin, make sure to check whether the hooks being used conflict with
# our custom plugin hooks and if so, manually call the other plugin's hooks in our
# custom plugin. (also applies to if the plugin is updated in the future)

;; Dependencies without annotations
;; Before ignoring a module, check to see if type stubs are available.
;; The `typeshed` project maintains stubs here:
;;     https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs
;; and for each package `foo` there's a corresponding `types-foo` package on PyPI,
;; which we can pull in as a dev dependency by adding to `pyproject.toml`'s
;; `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]` list.
