    # https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/11/21/We-should-all-be-using-dependency-cooldowns
    # where the author noted that 9/10 attacks would have been mitigated by a
    # two week cooldown.
    #
    # The cooldown only applies to general updates; security updates will still
    # be pulled in as soon as possible.
