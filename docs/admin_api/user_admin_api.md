# User Admin API

To use it, you will need to authenticate by providing an `access_token`
for a server admin: see [Admin API](../usage/administration/admin_api/).

## Query User Account

This API returns information about a specific user account.

The api is:

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v2/users/<user_id>
```

It returns a JSON body like the following:

```jsonc
{
    "name": "@user:example.com",
    "displayname": "User", // can be null if not set
    "threepids": [
        {
            "medium": "email",
            "address": "<user_mail_1>",
            "added_at": 1586458409743,
            "validated_at": 1586458409743
        },
        {
            "medium": "email",
            "address": "<user_mail_2>",
            "added_at": 1586458409743,
            "validated_at": 1586458409743
        }
    ],
    "avatar_url": "<avatar_url>",  // can be null if not set
    "is_guest": 0,
    "admin": 0,
    "deactivated": 0,
    "erased": false,
    "shadow_banned": 0,

    "consent_version": null,
    "consent_ts": null,
    "external_ids": [
        {
            "auth_provider": "<provider1>",
            "external_id": "<user_id_provider_1>"
        },
        {
            "auth_provider": "<provider2>",
            "external_id": "<user_id_provider_2>"
        }
    ],
    "user_type": null,
    "locked": false
}
```

URL parameters:

- `user_id`: fully-qualified user id: for example, `@user:server.com`.

## Create or modify account

This API allows an administrator to create or modify a user account with a
specific `user_id`.

This api is:

```
PUT /_synapse/admin/v2/users/<user_id>
```

with a body of:

```json
{
    "password": "user_password",
    "logout_devices": false,
    "displayname": "Alice Marigold",
    "avatar_url": "mxc://example.com/abcde12345",
    "threepids": [
        {
            "medium": "email",
            "address": "alice@example.com"
        },
        {
            "medium": "email",
            "address": "alice@domain.org"
        }
    ],
    "external_ids": [
        {
            "auth_provider": "example",
            "external_id": "12345"
        },
        {
            "auth_provider": "example2",
            "external_id": "abc54321"
        }
    ],
    "admin": false,
    "deactivated": false,
    "user_type": null,
    "locked": false
}
```

Returns HTTP status code:
- `201` - When a new user object was created.
- `200` - When a user was modified.

URL parameters:

- `user_id` - A fully-qualified user id. For example, `@user:server.com`.

Body parameters:

- `password` - **string**, optional. If provided, the user's password is updated and all
  devices are logged out, unless `logout_devices` is set to `false`.
- `logout_devices` - **bool**, optional, defaults to `true`. If set to `false`, devices aren't
  logged out even when `password` is provided.
- `displayname` - **string**, optional. If set to an empty string (`""`), the user's display name
  will be removed.
- `avatar_url` - **string**, optional. Must be a
  [MXC URI](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#matrix-content-mxc-uris).
  If set to an empty string (`""`), the user's avatar is removed.
- `threepids` - **array**, optional. If provided, the user's third-party IDs (email, msisdn) are
  entirely replaced with the given list. Each item in the array is an object with the following
  fields:
  - `medium` - **string**, required. The type of third-party ID, either `email` or `msisdn` (phone number).
  - `address` - **string**, required. The third-party ID itself, e.g. `alice@example.com` for `email` or
    `447470274584` (for a phone number with country code "44") and `19254857364` (for a phone number
    with country code "1") for `msisdn`.
  Note: If a threepid is removed from a user via this option, Synapse will also attempt to remove
  that threepid from any identity servers it is aware has a binding for it.
- `external_ids` - **array**, optional. Allow setting the identifier of the external identity
  provider for SSO (Single sign-on). More details are in the configuration manual under the
  sections [sso](../usage/configuration/config_documentation.md#sso) and [oidc_providers](../usage/configuration/config_documentation.md#oidc_providers).
  - `auth_provider` - **string**, required. The unique, internal ID of the external identity provider.
    The same as `idp_id` from the homeserver configuration. If using OIDC, this value should be prefixed
    with `oidc-`. Note that no error is raised if the provided value is not in the homeserver configuration.
  - `external_id` - **string**, required. An identifier for the user in the external identity provider.
    When the user logs in to the identity provider, this must be the unique ID that they map to.
- `admin` - **bool**, optional, defaults to `false`. Whether the user is a homeserver administrator,
  granting them access to the Admin API, among other things.
- `deactivated` - **bool**, optional. If unspecified, deactivation state will be left unchanged.

  Note:
  - For the password field there is no strict check of the necessity for its presence.
    It is possible to have active users without a password, e.g. when authenticating with OIDC is configured.
    You must check yourself whether a password is required when reactivating a user or not.
  - It is not possible to set a password if the config option `password_config.localdb_enabled` is set `false`.
  Users' passwords are wiped upon account deactivation, hence the need to set a new one here.

  Note: a user cannot be erased with this API. For more details on
  deactivating and erasing users see [Deactivate Account](#deactivate-account).
- `locked` - **bool**, optional. If unspecified, locked state will be left unchanged.
- `user_type` - **string** or null, optional. If not provided, the user type will be
  not be changed. If `null` is given, the user type will be cleared.
  Other allowed options are: `bot` and `support`.

## List Accounts
### List Accounts (V2)

This API returns all local user accounts.
By default, the response is ordered by ascending user ID.

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v2/users?from=0&limit=10&guests=false
```

A response body like the following is returned:

```json
{
    "users": [
        {
            "name": "<user_id1>",
            "is_guest": 0,
            "admin": 0,
            "user_type": null,
            "deactivated": 0,
            "erased": false,
            "shadow_banned": 0,
            "displayname": "<User One>",
            "avatar_url": null,
            "creation_ts": 1560432668000,
            "locked": false
        }, {
            "name": "<user_id2>",
            "is_guest": 0,
            "admin": 1,
            "user_type": null,
            "deactivated": 0,
            "erased": false,
            "shadow_banned": 0,
            "displayname": "<User Two>",
            "avatar_url": "<avatar_url>",
            "creation_ts": 1561550621000,
            "locked": false
        }
    ],
    "next_token": "100",
    "total": 200
}
```

To paginate, check for `next_token` and if present, call the endpoint again
with `from` set to the value of `next_token`. This will return a new page.

If the endpoint does not return a `next_token` then there are no more users
to paginate through.

**Parameters**

The following parameters should be set in the URL:

- `user_id` - Is optional and filters to only return users with user IDs
  that contain this value. This parameter is ignored when using the `name` parameter.
- `name` - Is optional and filters to only return users with user ID localparts
  **or** displaynames that contain this value.
- `guests` - string representing a bool - Is optional and if `false` will **exclude** guest users.
  Defaults to `true` to include guest users. This parameter is not supported when MSC3861 is enabled. [See #15582](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/15582)
- `admins` - Optional flag to filter admins. If `true`, only admins are queried. If `false`, admins are excluded from
  the query. When the flag is absent (the default), **both** admins and non-admins are included in the search results.
- `deactivated` - string representing a bool - Is optional and if `true` will **include** deactivated users.
  Defaults to `false` to exclude deactivated users.
- `limit` - string representing a positive integer - Is optional but is used for pagination,
  denoting the maximum number of items to return in this call. Defaults to `100`.
- `from` - string representing a positive integer - Is optional but used for pagination,
  denoting the offset in the returned results. This should be treated as an opaque value and
  not explicitly set to anything other than the return value of `next_token` from a previous call.
  Defaults to `0`.
- `order_by` - The method by which to sort the returned list of users.
  If the ordered field has duplicates, the second order is always by ascending `name`,
  which guarantees a stable ordering. Valid values are:

  - `name` - Users are ordered alphabetically by `name`. This is the default.
  - `is_guest` - Users are ordered by `is_guest` status.
  - `admin` - Users are ordered by `admin` status.
  - `user_type` - Users are ordered alphabetically by `user_type`.
  - `deactivated` - Users are ordered by `deactivated` status.
  - `shadow_banned` - Users are ordered by `shadow_banned` status.
  - `displayname` - Users are ordered alphabetically by `displayname`.
  - `avatar_url` - Users are ordered alphabetically by avatar URL.
  - `creation_ts` - Users are ordered by when the users was created in ms.
  - `last_seen_ts` - Users are ordered by when the user was lastly seen in ms.

- `dir` - Direction of media order. Either `f` for forwards or `b` for backwards.
  Setting this value to `b` will reverse the above sort order. Defaults to `f`.
- `not_user_type` - Exclude certain user types, such as bot users, from the request.
   Can be provided multiple times. Possible values are `bot`, `support` or "empty string".
   "empty string" here means to exclude users without a type.
- `locked` - string representing a bool - Is optional and if `true` will **include** locked users.
  Defaults to `false` to exclude locked users. Note: Introduced in v1.93.

Caution. The database only has indexes on the columns `name` and `creation_ts`.
This means that if a different sort order is used (`is_guest`, `admin`,
`user_type`, `deactivated`, `shadow_banned`, `avatar_url` or `displayname`),
this can cause a large load on the database, especially for large environments.

**Response**

The following fields are returned in the JSON response body:

- `users` - An array of objects, each containing information about an user.
  User objects contain the following fields:

  - `name` - string - Fully-qualified user ID (ex. `@user:server.com`).
  - `is_guest` - bool - Status if that user is a guest account.
  - `admin` - bool - Status if that user is a server administrator.
  - `user_type` - string - Type of the user. Normal users are type `None`.
    This allows user type specific behaviour. There are also types `support` and `bot`.
  - `deactivated` - bool - Status if that user has been marked as deactivated.
  - `erased` - bool - Status if that user has been marked as erased.
  - `shadow_banned` - bool - Status if that user has been marked as shadow banned.
  - `displayname` - string - The user's display name if they have set one.
  - `avatar_url` - string -  The user's avatar URL if they have set one.
  - `creation_ts` - integer - The user's creation timestamp in ms.
  - `last_seen_ts` - integer - The user's last activity timestamp in ms.
  - `locked` - bool - Status if that user has been marked as locked. Note: Introduced in v1.93.
- `next_token`: string representing a positive integer - Indication for pagination. See above.
- `total` - integer - Total number of media.

*Added in Synapse 1.93:* the `locked` query parameter and response field.

### List Accounts (V3)

This API returns all local user accounts (see v2). In contrast to v2, the query parameter `deactivated` is handled differently.

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v3/users
```

**Parameters**
- `deactivated` - Optional flag to filter deactivated users. If `true`, only deactivated users are returned.
  If `false`, deactivated users are excluded from the query. When the flag is absent (the default),
  users are not filtered by deactivation status.

## Query current sessions for a user

This API returns information about the active sessions for a specific user.

The endpoints are:

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v1/whois/<user_id>
```

and:

```
GET /_matrix/client/r0/admin/whois/<userId>
```

See also: [Client Server
API Whois](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#get-matrix-client-r0-admin-whois-userid).

It returns a JSON body like the following:

```json
{
    "user_id": "<user_id>",
    "devices": {
        "": {
            "sessions": [
                {
                    "connections": [
                        {
                            "ip": "1.2.3.4",
                            "last_seen": 1417222374433,
                            "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 ..."
                        },
                        {
                            "ip": "1.2.3.10",
                            "last_seen": 1417222374500,
                            "user_agent": "Dalvik/2.1.0 ..."
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

`last_seen` is measured in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

## Deactivate Account

This API deactivates an account. It removes active access tokens, resets the
password, and deletes third-party IDs (to prevent the user requesting a
password reset).

It can also mark the user as GDPR-erased. This means messages sent by the
user will still be visible by anyone that was in the room when these messages
were sent, but hidden from users joining the room afterwards.

The api is:

```
POST /_synapse/admin/v1/deactivate/<user_id>
```

with a body of:

```json
{
    "erase": true
}
```

The erase parameter is optional and defaults to `false`.
An empty body may be passed for backwards compatibility.

The following actions are performed when deactivating an user:

- Try to unbind 3PIDs from the identity server
- Remove all 3PIDs from the homeserver
- Delete all devices and E2EE keys
- Delete all access tokens
- Delete all pushers
- Delete the password hash
- Removal from all rooms the user is a member of
- Remove the user from the user directory
- Reject all pending invites
- Remove all account validity information related to the user
- Remove the arbitrary data store known as *account data*. For example, this includes:
    - list of ignored users;
    - push rules;
    - secret storage keys; and
    - cross-signing keys.

The following additional actions are performed during deactivation if `erase`
is set to `true`:

- Remove the user's display name
- Remove the user's avatar URL
- Mark the user as erased

The following actions are **NOT** performed. The list may be incomplete.

- Remove mappings of SSO IDs
- [Delete media uploaded](#delete-media-uploaded-by-a-user) by user (included avatar images)
- Delete sent and received messages
- Remove the user's creation (registration) timestamp
- [Remove rate limit overrides](#override-ratelimiting-for-users)
- Remove from monthly active users
- Remove user's consent information (consent version and timestamp)

## Reset password

**Note:** This API is disabled when MSC3861 is enabled. [See #15582](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/15582)

Changes the password of another user. This will automatically log the user out of all their devices.

The api is:

```
POST /_synapse/admin/v1/reset_password/<user_id>
```

with a body of:

```json
{
   "new_password": "<secret>",
   "logout_devices": true
}
```

The parameter `new_password` is required.
The parameter `logout_devices` is optional and defaults to `true`.


## Get whether a user is a server administrator or not

**Note:** This API is disabled when MSC3861 is enabled. [See #15582](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/15582)

The api is:

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/admin
```

A response body like the following is returned:

```json
{
    "admin": true
}
```


## Change whether a user is a server administrator or not

**Note:** This API is disabled when MSC3861 is enabled. [See #15582](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/15582)

Note that you cannot demote yourself.

The api is:

```
PUT /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/admin
```

with a body of:

```json
{
    "admin": true
}
```

## List room memberships of a user

Gets a list of all `room_id` that a specific `user_id` is member.

The API is:

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/joined_rooms
```

A response body like the following is returned:

```json
    {
        "joined_rooms": [
            "!DuGcnbhHGaSZQoNQR:matrix.org",
            "!ZtSaPCawyWtxfWiIy:matrix.org"
        ],
        "total": 2
    }
```

The server returns the list of rooms of which the user and the server
are member. If the user is local, all the rooms of which the user is
member are returned.

**Parameters**

            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Parameters**

The following parameters should be set in the URL:

- `user_id` - fully qualified: for example, `@user:server.com`.

**Response**

The following fields are returned in the JSON response body:

- `account_data` - A map containing the account data for the user
  - `global` - A map containing the global account data for the user
  - `rooms` - A map containing the account data per room for the user

## User media

### List media uploaded by a user
Gets a list of all local media that a specific `user_id` has created.
These are media that the user has uploaded themselves
([local media](../media_repository.md#local-media)), as well as
[URL preview images](../media_repository.md#url-previews) requested by the user if the
[feature is enabled](../usage/configuration/config_documentation.md#url_preview_enabled).

By default, the response is ordered by descending creation date and ascending media ID.
The newest media is on top. You can change the order with parameters
`order_by` and `dir`.

The API is:

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/media
```

A response body like the following is returned:

```json
{
  "media": [
    {
      "created_ts": 100400,
      "last_access_ts": null,
      "media_id": "qXhyRzulkwLsNHTbpHreuEgo",
      "media_length": 67,

      "quarantined_by": null,
      "safe_from_quarantine": false,
      "upload_name": "test1.png"
    },
    {
      "created_ts": 200400,
      "last_access_ts": null,
      "media_id": "FHfiSnzoINDatrXHQIXBtahw",
      "media_length": 67,
      "media_type": "image/png",
      "quarantined_by": null,
      "safe_from_quarantine": false,
      "upload_name": "test2.png"
    },
    {
      "created_ts": 300400,
      "last_access_ts": 300700,
      "media_id": "BzYNLRUgGHphBkdKGbzXwbjX",
      "media_length": 1337,
      "media_type": "application/octet-stream",
      "quarantined_by": null,
      "safe_from_quarantine": false,
      "upload_name": null
    }
  ],
  "next_token": 3,
  "total": 2
}
```

To paginate, check for `next_token` and if present, call the endpoint again
with `from` set to the value of `next_token`. This will return a new page.

If the endpoint does not return a `next_token` then there are no more
reports to paginate through.

**Parameters**

The following parameters should be set in the URL:

- `user_id` - string - fully qualified: for example, `@user:server.com`.
- `limit`: string representing a positive integer - Is optional but is used for pagination,
  denoting the maximum number of items to return in this call. Defaults to `100`.
- `from`: string representing a positive integer - Is optional but used for pagination,
  denoting the offset in the returned results. This should be treated as an opaque value and
  not explicitly set to anything other than the return value of `next_token` from a previous call.
  Defaults to `0`.
- `order_by` - The method by which to sort the returned list of media.
  If the ordered field has duplicates, the second order is always by ascending `media_id`,
  which guarantees a stable ordering. Valid values are:

  - `media_id` - Media are ordered alphabetically by `media_id`.
  - `upload_name` - Media are ordered alphabetically by name the media was uploaded with.
  - `created_ts` - Media are ordered by when the content was uploaded in ms.
    Smallest to largest. This is the default.
  - `last_access_ts` - Media are ordered by when the content was last accessed in ms.
    Smallest to largest.
  - `media_length` - Media are ordered by length of the media in bytes.
    Smallest to largest.
  - `media_type` - Media are ordered alphabetically by MIME-type.
  - `quarantined_by` - Media are ordered alphabetically by the user ID that
    initiated the quarantine request for this media.
  - `safe_from_quarantine` - Media are ordered by the status if this media is safe
    from quarantining.

- `dir` - Direction of media order. Either `f` for forwards or `b` for backwards.
  Setting this value to `b` will reverse the above sort order. Defaults to `f`.

If neither `order_by` nor `dir` is set, the default order is newest media on top
(corresponds to `order_by` = `created_ts` and `dir` = `b`).

Caution. The database only has indexes on the columns `media_id`,
`user_id` and `created_ts`. This means that if a different sort order is used
(`upload_name`, `last_access_ts`, `media_length`, `media_type`,
`quarantined_by` or `safe_from_quarantine`), this can cause a large load on the
database, especially for large environments.

**Response**

The following fields are returned in the JSON response body:

- `media` - An array of objects, each containing information about a media.
  Media objects contain the following fields:
  - `created_ts` - integer - Timestamp when the content was uploaded in ms.
  - `last_access_ts` - integer or null - Timestamp when the content was last accessed in ms.
     Null if there was no access, yet.
  - `media_id` - string - The id used to refer to the media. Details about the format
    are documented under
    [media repository](../media_repository.md).
  - `media_length` - integer - Length of the media in bytes.
  - `media_type` - string - The MIME-type of the media.
  - `quarantined_by` - string or null - The user ID that initiated the quarantine request
    for this media. Null if not quarantined.
  - `safe_from_quarantine` - bool - Status if this media is safe from quarantining.
  - `upload_name` - string or null - The name the media was uploaded with. Null if not provided during upload.
- `next_token`: integer - Indication for pagination. See above.
- `total` - integer - Total number of media.

### Delete media uploaded by a user

This API deletes the *local* media from the disk of your own server
that a specific `user_id` has created. This includes any local thumbnails.

This API will not affect media that has been uploaded to external
media repositories (e.g https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/).

By default, the API deletes media ordered by descending creation date and ascending media ID.
The newest media is deleted first. You can change the order with parameters
`order_by` and `dir`. If no `limit` is set the API deletes `100` files per request.

The API is:

```
DELETE /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/media
```

A response body like the following is returned:

```json
{
  "deleted_media": [
    "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx"
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

The following fields are returned in the JSON response body:

* `deleted_media`: an array of strings - List of deleted `media_id`
* `total`: integer - Total number of deleted `media_id`

**Note**: There is no `next_token`. This is not useful for deleting media, because
after deleting media the remaining media have a new order.

**Parameters**

This API has the same parameters as
[List media uploaded by a user](#list-media-uploaded-by-a-user).
With the parameters you can for example limit the number of files to delete at once or
delete largest/smallest or newest/oldest files first.

## Login as a user

**Note:** This API is disabled when MSC3861 is enabled. [See #15582](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/15582)

Get an access token that can be used to authenticate as that user. Useful for
when admins wish to do actions on behalf of a user.

The API is:

```
POST /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/login
{}
```

An optional `valid_until_ms` field can be specified in the request body as an
integer timestamp that specifies when the token should expire. By default tokens
do not expire. Note that this API does not allow a user to login as themselves
(to create more tokens).

A response body like the following is returned:

```json
{
    "access_token": "<opaque_access_token_string>"
}
```

This API does *not* generate a new device for the user, and so will not appear
their `/devices` list, and in general the target user should not be able to
tell they have been logged in as.

To expire the token call the standard `/logout` API with the token.

Note: The token will expire if the *admin* user calls `/logout/all` from any
of their devices, but the token will *not* expire if the target user does the
same.

## Allow replacing master cross-signing key without User-Interactive Auth

This endpoint is not intended for server administrator usage;
we describe it here for completeness.

This API temporarily permits a user to replace their master cross-signing key
without going through
[user-interactive authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.8/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api) (UIA).
This is useful when Synapse has delegated its authentication to the
[Matrix Authentication Service](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-authentication-service/);
as Synapse cannot perform UIA is not possible in these circumstances.

The API is

```http request
POST /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/_allow_cross_signing_replacement_without_uia
{}
```

If the user does not exist, or does exist but has no master cross-signing key,
this will return with status code `404 Not Found`.

Otherwise, a response body like the following is returned, with status `200 OK`:

```json
{
    "updatable_without_uia_before_ms": 1234567890
}
```

The response body is a JSON object with a single field:

- `updatable_without_uia_before_ms`: integer. The timestamp in milliseconds
  before which the user is permitted to replace their cross-signing key without
  going through UIA.

_Added in Synapse 1.97.0._

## Controlling whether a user is shadow-banned

Shadow-banning is a useful tool for moderating malicious or egregiously abusive users.
A shadow-banned users receives successful responses to their client-server API requests,
but the events are not propagated into rooms. This can be an effective tool as it
(hopefully) takes longer for the user to realise they are being moderated before
pivoting to another account.

Shadow-banning a user should be used as a tool of last resort and may lead to confusing
or broken behaviour for the client. A shadow-banned user will not receive any
notification and it is generally more appropriate to ban or kick abusive users.
A shadow-banned user will be unable to contact anyone on the server.

To shadow-ban a user the API is:

```
POST /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/shadow_ban
```

To un-shadow-ban a user the API is:

```
DELETE /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/shadow_ban
```

An empty JSON dict is returned in both cases.

**Parameters**

The following parameters should be set in the URL:

- `user_id` - The fully qualified MXID: for example, `@user:server.com`. The user must
  be local.

## Override ratelimiting for users

This API allows to override or disable ratelimiting for a specific user.
There are specific APIs to set, get and delete a ratelimit.

### Get status of ratelimit

The API is:

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/override_ratelimit
```

A response body like the following is returned:

```json
{
  "messages_per_second": 0,
  "burst_count": 0
}
```

**Parameters**

The following parameters should be set in the URL:

- `user_id` - The fully qualified MXID: for example, `@user:server.com`. The user must
  be local.

**Response**

The following fields are returned in the JSON response body:

- `messages_per_second` - integer - The number of actions that can
  be performed in a second. `0` mean that ratelimiting is disabled for this user.
- `burst_count` - integer - How many actions that can be performed before
  being limited.

If **no** custom ratelimit is set, an empty JSON dict is returned.

```json
{}
```

### Set ratelimit

The API is:

```
POST /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/override_ratelimit
```

A response body like the following is returned:

```json
{
  "messages_per_second": 0,
  "burst_count": 0
}
```

**Parameters**

The following parameters should be set in the URL:

- `user_id` - The fully qualified MXID: for example, `@user:server.com`. The user must
  be local.

Body parameters:

- `messages_per_second` - positive integer, optional. The number of actions that can
  be performed in a second. Defaults to `0`.
- `burst_count` - positive integer, optional. How many actions that can be performed
  before being limited. Defaults to `0`.

To disable users' ratelimit set both values to `0`.

**Response**

The following fields are returned in the JSON response body:

- `messages_per_second` - integer - The number of actions that can
  be performed in a second.
- `burst_count` - integer - How many actions that can be performed before
  being limited.

### Delete ratelimit

The API is:

```
DELETE /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id>/override_ratelimit
```

An empty JSON dict is returned.

```json
{}
```

**Parameters**

The following parameters should be set in the URL:

- `user_id` - The fully qualified MXID: for example, `@user:server.com`. The user must
  be local.

## Check username availability

Checks to see if a username is available, and valid, for the server. See [the client-server
API](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#get-matrix-client-r0-register-available)
for more information.

This endpoint will work even if registration is disabled on the server, unlike
`/_matrix/client/r0/register/available`.

The API is:

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v1/username_available?username=$localpart
```

The request and response format is the same as the
[/_matrix/client/r0/register/available](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#get-matrix-client-r0-register-available) API.

## Find a user based on their ID in an auth provider

The API is:

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v1/auth_providers/$provider/users/$external_id
```

When a user matched the given ID for the given provider, an HTTP code `200` with a response body like the following is returned:

```json
{
    "user_id": "@hello:example.org"
}
```

**Parameters**

The following parameters should be set in the URL:

- `provider` - The ID of the authentication provider, as advertised by the [`GET /_matrix/client/v3/login`](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3login) API in the `m.login.sso` authentication method.
- `external_id` - The user ID from the authentication provider. Usually corresponds to the `sub` claim for OIDC providers, or to the `uid` attestation for SAML2 providers.

The `external_id` may have characters that are not URL-safe (typically `/`, `:` or `@`), so it is advised to URL-encode those parameters.

**Errors**

Returns a `404` HTTP status code if no user was found, with a response body like this:

```json
{
    "errcode":"M_NOT_FOUND",
    "error":"User not found"
}
```

_Added in Synapse 1.68.0._


## Find a user based on their Third Party ID (ThreePID or 3PID)

The API is:

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v1/threepid/$medium/users/$address
```

When a user matched the given address for the given medium, an HTTP code `200` with a response body like the following is returned:

```json
{
    "user_id": "@hello:example.org"
}
```

**Parameters**

The following parameters should be set in the URL:

- `medium` - Kind of third-party ID, either `email` or `msisdn`.
- `address` - Value of the third-party ID.

The `address` may have characters that are not URL-safe, so it is advised to URL-encode those parameters.

**Errors**

Returns a `404` HTTP status code if no user was found, with a response body like this:

```json
{
    "errcode":"M_NOT_FOUND",
    "error":"User not found"
}
```

_Added in Synapse 1.72.0._
